Hammond Organ-like, Lorentz Force actuated chordophone instrument

The whole idea behind instrument is based on two physical phenomena - waves on a string, and Lorentz force working on a conductor in magnetic field.
The first is described by folowing Partial Differential Equation:
$$\boxed{\pdv[2]{y}{t}+\gamma\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}-c^{2}\pdv[2]{y}{x}=\frac{1}{\rho}F\left( x,t \right)}$$
The next one, the Lorentz force, is in this case described by the following:
$$\boxed{\overrightarrow{F}=I\overrightarrow{l}\times\overrightarrow{B}}$$
