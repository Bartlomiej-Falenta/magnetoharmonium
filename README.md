Hammond Organ-like, Lorentz Force actuated chordophone instrument

The whole idea behind instrument is based on two physical phenomena - waves on a string, and Lorentz force working on a conductor in magnetic field.

**The first is described by folowing PDE (partial differential equation):**

$$\boxed{\frac{\partial ^{2} y}{\partial t^{2}}+\gamma\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}-v^{2}\frac{\partial ^{2} y}{\partial x^{2}}=\frac{1}{\rho}F\left( x,t \right)}$$

**The next one, the Lorentz force, is in this case described by the following:**

$$\boxed{\overrightarrow{F}=I\overrightarrow{l}\times\overrightarrow{B}}$$
