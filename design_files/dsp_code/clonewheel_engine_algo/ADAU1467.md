MUST READ!

**UPDATE:**
Since I've decided to use different IC as my main „synthesis engine”, ADAU1467 will no longer be used (at all, actually). *However*, I'll keep its files in separate, „ARCHIVED” folder.

This is ONLY SigmaStudio dsp project file, made specifically for ADAU1467 - won't work with anything else, probably won't work at all yet!
